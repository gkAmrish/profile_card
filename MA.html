            Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British
            Crown colony of Aden (present-day Yemen) into a Gujarati Hindu
            family to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. He has a younger
            brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam Kothari and
            Dipti Dattaraj Salgaonkar. Ambani was lived only briefly in Yemen
            because his father was decided to move back to India in the tear of
            1958[14] to start a trading business that focused on spices and
            textiles. The latter was originally named "Vimal" but later changed
            to "Only Vimal". His family was lived in a modest two-bedroom
            apartment in Bhuleshwar,until the 1970s.
